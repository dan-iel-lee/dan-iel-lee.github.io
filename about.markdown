Welcome to my blog. I am (as of Fall 2020) a Junior at UPenn pursuing a bachelor's in CS and Math Econ, as well as a master's in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Information and Decision Systems. 

My current technical interests lie in programming languages, formal verification and machine learning. I'm also interested in questions about knowledge/epistomology, logic and the foundations of math and computing, human behavior, societal behavior, and overall trying to understand the how the world works at both a micro and a macro level.
