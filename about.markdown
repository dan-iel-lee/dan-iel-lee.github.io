Welcome to my blog. I am (as of Spring 2022) a Senior at UPenn pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematical Economics, as well as Masters degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics.

My interests lie in theoretical computer science as a whole. In particular, recently I've been working on topics in online learning, game theory, and algorithmic fairness. I also enjoy thinking about cryptography, computational complexity, and graph theory. In the past, I've done some research in programming languages theory as well, with forays into category theory and Homotopy Type Theory.
