*A blog for exploring my random (but usually math/computer science related) thoughts, ideas, and one week long obsessions.*

This has gotten a lot more hits than I'd expected, so I thought I'd give anyone interested some more context about me.Â 

I'm an undergrad in CS and Math Econ at UPenn (and planning on a master's in EE), and currently interning at Amazon. Right now (and this is an extremely qualified *right now*, this is apt to change at any moment) I'm interested statistics/machine learning, as well as questions of authentication, security, and privacy.

I'd love to hear from anyone with feedback, comments, and especially criticism, or who's just interested in chatting about math/CS!
