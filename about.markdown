Welcome to my blog. I am now (as of Fall 2022) a Quant Trader at Susquehanna International Group. Previously, I went to UPenn where I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematical Economics, as well as Masters degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics.

My interests lie in theoretical computer science as a whole. In particular, recently I've been working on topics in online learning, game theory, and algorithmic fairness. I also enjoy thinking about cryptography, computational complexity, and graph theory. In the past, I've done some research in programming languages theory as well, with forays into category theory and Homotopy Type Theory.
